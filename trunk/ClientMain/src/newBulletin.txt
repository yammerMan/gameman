 We've been wanting to get on Kongregate.com Flash game platform since day one of our development. Just got a reply from Anthony of Kongregate an hour ago and they seem to be interested in partnering with us to launch our first English version!
 We're told that we'd be hearing from them later today. We're waiting for a "yes" from their management to go ahead with the integration.
 Caesary English version is about to meet the eyes of the world. Way to go, Caesary team!
