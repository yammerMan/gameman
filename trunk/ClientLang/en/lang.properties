Creating more Husbandry jobs boosts Crops production. The higher its level, the faster the jobs are created and the more jobs it can create, one at a time, per request.
building.farm.desc=Crop rotation and basic land management sustain the ecology of farm land. By changing field usage every year and allowing land to lie fallow or be used as pasture, the goodness of the land is slowly restored. Crop yields and surpluses improve as a result, and the increased output adds to population growth. Slave labour also helps, as peasant farmers generally keep more produce for themselves.
building.farm.func={1} Lv {0} can create, one at a time, up to {2} Husbandry jobs on each Create Jobs request, and shorten a job's creation time by {3} second(s).

townHall.multiplyTheEarth=Increases up to {0} Current Population
townHall.levyEffect=This time you can Levy on {0} {1}, but Allegiance will drop {2} , so be careful.
townHall.goldIncome=Hourly levy of Sesterces: {0}.
townHall.taxNotice=Tax revenue is levied in Sesterces. Current Population and Tax Rate affect Sesterces production. The higher the Current Population, the higher the Sesterces production.\nAppointing a hero to Consul can boost Sesterces production. The higher the Sway of the hero, the bigger the boost.\nBoth Mercury Statue and Mercury Acrolith can buff up Sesterces production.\nStudying Finance in University can boost Sesterces production. The higher the Finance level, the bigger the boost.\n\nPS: Allegiance = 100 - Tax Rate - Grievance. Raising Tax Rate causes gradual decrease in Allegiance and raises 1 Grievance until the equilibrium state of the equation is reached. Thus, think twice before raising it!
townHall.label.taxRate=Tax Rate
townHall.label.taxRateTip=Shortcut to "Adjust Tax Rate" in Rectorate.
townHall.label.ChangetaxRateSuccess=Tax rate successfully adjusted!

townHall.label.efficiency=Required Workers Utility Rate (RWUR)
townHall.label.efficiency.tip=If Current Population is sufficient to fill the need of Required Workers, RWUR is 100%.\nHowever, when the Current Population is insufficient, RWUR = Current Population ÷ ∑ Required Workers (Required Farmer + Required Logger + Required Mason + Required Miner).
townHall.label.curWorker=Current Workers
townHall.label.curWorker.tip=Current Workers are mainly limited by Current Population.\n\nIf Current Population is sufficient to fill the need of Required Workers, Current Workers equal Required Workers. \n\nIf Current Population is insufficient to fill the need of Required Workers, Current Workers = Required Workers × Required Workers Fill Rate (RWFR).\n\nYou see, RWFR doesn't come into the picture if you have sufficient Current Population. Only when the Current Population is insufficient, RWFR becomes a multiplying factor. The above RWFR has to be worked out from this formula first:\nRWFR = Current Population ÷ ∑ Required Workers (Required Farmer + Required Logger + Required Mason + Required Miner).
townHall.label.throughput=Resource Field Production Capacity
townHall.label.throughput.tip=Number of resource that a resource field (Farm, Sawmill, Quarry or Iron Mine) is capable of producing hourly. It equals Occupancy Rate × Base Production. Thus, when Job Occupancy Rate equals 100%, it equals Base Production.

townHall.label.workerInNeed=Required Workers
townHall.label.workerInNeed.tip=Number of Idle Population required to fill the Available Jobs.\n\nAdjust Target Job Occupancy Rate (TJOR) to alter the value of Required Workers. Thus, when TJOR is set at 100%, Required Workers = Available Jobs.\n\nRequired Workers = Available Jobs x TJOR
townHall.label.workerEfficiency=Target Job Occupancy Rate (TJOR)
townHall.label.workerEfficiency.tip=Adjust TJOR to alter Required Workers based on the Available Jobs. The general goal of adjustment is to optimize resource production efficiency. You may also strategically adjust it to fit your own development agenda, such as decrease it to free Current Workers to Idle Population to Soldier Population to fill the need of training and manufacturing troop units.\n\nPlay around with TJOR just to see how it affects the other resource production performance indicators!
townHall.population.free.tip=Current Population – ∑ Current Workers
townHall.label.totalOutPut=Net Resource Yield (NRY)
townHall.label.totalOutPut.tip=Base Production + Technology Boost + Troop Consumption + Hero Boost + Wilderness Boost + Item Boost + Troop Consumption + Tributary Balance + Natural Providence

townHall.label.barbarismOutput.tip=System give away 15 unit of resource hourly to each of the four resources. (Eywa provides, so does the Caesary system!)
townHall.label.basicOutPut=Base Production
townHall.label.basicOutPut.tip=Every worker of a respective resource is capable of producing certain amount of resource unit per hour.\n\nA worker's hourly production unit for Crop is 10/h, Lumber is 10/h, Stone is 5/h, and Iron is 4/h. In other words, a Farmer grows 10 Crops/h; a Logger logs 10 Lumber/h; a Mason pounds 5 Stone/h; and a Miner mines 4 Iron/h.\n\nBase Production = Current Workers × the above respective hourly rate. For example, Base Production of Crops = Current Farmers × 10/h.\n\nBase Production doesn't say much about the overall production balance of resource (Net Resource Yield (NRY)), but it serves as the multiplying factor when boost are taken into consideration: technology boost, hero boost, wilderness boost, and item boost.
townHall.label.tradeOutPut=Outpost Balance
townHall.label.tradeOutPut.tip=Outpost Supply Line that channels out the resources is notated in negative number, and of that which channels in is notated in positive number. Outpost Balance is the sum of in and out.\n\nNote: Outpost Balance is not part of the Net Resource Yield (NRY).
townHall.label.statusBuf=Item Boost
townHall.label.statusBuf.tip=Buy various production boost item from Item Mall > Production to add boost to your production.\n\nFor example, Saturn Acrolith buffs Crops production rate by 25% in the next 24 hours. Once you get it, the corresponding Item Boost for Crops\n= Base Production for Crops × 25%\n= Base Production for Crops × 0.25
townHall.costFood.tip=Crops consumption by your troops is notated only in negative number. Troops who garrison in wilderness and other player's cities consume the Crops of their home cities (departure cities).
townHall.vassal.addition.tip=Tributary city offers 20% of their Base Production to Sovereign city. Your city can be someone's Sovereign city while, at the same time, be someone else's Tributary city. The in and out balance of Tributary is Tributary Balance.
townHall.label.tecBuf=Technology Boost
townHall.label.tecBuf.tip=Technology Boost = Base Production × the level of Technology × 10%\n\nFor example, with Agronomy Lv 6, Technology Boost for Crops\n= Base Production of Crops × 6 × 10%\n= Base Production of Crops × 0.6
townHall.label.heroBuf=Hero Boost
townHall.label.heroBuf.tip=When you appoint a hero as Consul, higher his or her Sway, higher the production boost.\n\nHero Boost = Base Production × Sway × 0.5%\n\nFor example, a Consul with 58 Sway, Hero Boost for Crops\n= Base Production for Crops × 58  × 0.5%\n= Base Production for Crops × 0.29
townHall.label.fieldBuf=Wilderness Boost
townHall.label.fieldBuf.tip=All Seized wilderness except Flatland can boost resource production. The higher the wilderness level, the higher the boost.\n\nFor example, after you Seize a Mountain Lv 8, the corresponding Wilderness Boost for Iron\n= Base Production for Iron × 8 × 3%\n= Base Production for Iron × 0.24
townHall.label.cityChageNameDsc=Identify your city with a creative name so that you'll be recognized and even glorified as you advance your city level!

scout.func.desc=Speculatores participate in Scout expedition only. You can improve their performance by studying technology.
resistrush.desc=A Hastatus can disarm Equites' Ambush Assault, effectively protecting distal division in the rear.
scattering.desc=Attaining Footpace Lv 7, Sagittarii get Dispersion, enable them to attack all enemy units at once but causing only a quarter of the usual damage as when it's hitting just one particular unit. (Dispersion is only used against divisions if the damage to their HP is greater than Sagittarii' regular attack.)
rush.desc=With Equitation Lv 7, Equites get Ambush Assault, which power becomes effectual instantly. It adds collateral damage to the rear division with magnitude that's half of the front when Equites attack a forefront division (not diagonal). However, a rear division suffers no collateral damage from Ambush Assault if Hastati is the forefront division. Flank assault doesn't invoke Ambush Assault.
sweeparmy.desc=Annihilation Sweep comes in handy at the end of a forefront attack. After destroying the forefront enemy division, without having to wait for another round, Annihilation Sweep enables Equites to attack the remaining divisions of the enemy hero. The all out attack towards the rest of the divisions is done without deduction in damage to individual division.
sideinjure.desc=When the front line enemy division standing in front of the Equites is empty or fallen, Equites' Flank Assail boosts the damage by 50% with Flank Expedience.
perforation.desc=Upon attaining Arming Lv 7, Piercing is enabled on Ballistae which add collateral damage to a rear division in the same column. This added damage is equal to half of what the front division would take, and will not take effect diagonally.
tozt.desc=Upon attaining Arming Lv 7, Onagers get Fire Balls which double their damaging power. Additionally they bring collateral damage to Barbicans when attacking the Wall. The collateral damage done to Barbicans is half of that done to the Wall.
longrangestrike.desc=Principes are uniquely gifted with Missile technique that enables them to launch auxiliary attack (in the first 2 rounds only). Missile automatically selects optimal division (both distal and proximal ones) to attack to maximize the theoretical damage (but actual damage may differ due to damage curb of individual troop's unit). Missile's auxiliary damage is half of that of Principes' close combat.

tf.population.desc=Men and women enlisted from Current Population to be trained as soldiers to work in infantry units (Hastatus, Sagittarius, Principes), horseman units (Speculatore, Equites), and siege engine units (Ballistae, Onagers). A unit of Hastatus occupies 1 Soldier Population, Sagittarius 1, Principes 6, Speculatore 1, Equites 3, Ballistae 4, and Onagers 8.
tf.archers.history.desc=Belongs to the Distal Division almost exclusively and supports the war effort of Hastati. Their lack of armour and poor hand weapons mean that only a heartless or desperate commander would deliberately order them to fight in hand-to-hand combat. Archery is not really a significant part of the Roman way of warfare, but the need for some missile troops is obvious to Roman commanders, and hence these Sagittarii are recruited from among the labour classes.
tf.ballistas.history.desc=The ballista (Latin, from Greek  βαλλίστρα - ballistra and that from - βάλλω ballō, "to throw"), plural ballistae, was a weapon developed from earlier Greek weapons. It relied upon different mechanics, using two levers with torsion springs instead of a prod, the springs consisting of several loops of twisted skins. Early versions ejected heavy darts or spherical stone projectiles of various sizes for siege warfare.\nThe early Roman ballistae were made of wood, and held together with iron plates around the frames and iron nails in the stand. The main stand had a slider on the top, into which were loaded the bolts or stone 'shot'. Attached to this, at the back, was a pair of 'Winches' and a 'Claw', used to ratchet the bowstring back to the armed firing position.\nThe slider passed through the field frames of the weapon, in which were located the torsion springs (rope made of animal sinew), which were twisted around the bow arms, which in turn were attached to the bowstring.
tf.cavalry.history.desc=Spear-armed cavalry who have a screening role in a Roman army.  Disciplined and fierce, they're recruited from the strongest tribes along the Roman borders, where those of non-Italian descents congregate. They can charge enemies to win. Roman cavalry only came into existence after the army reforms of Gaius Marius as a replacement force for the equites. The property qualifications for fighting as cavalry in the army were abandoned.
tf.onagers.history.desc=The onager was a Roman  siege engine, which derived its name from the kicking action of the machine, similar to that of an onager (wild ass). It is a type of catapult  that uses torsional pressure, generally from twisted rope, to store energy for the shot. The onager consisted of a large frame placed on the ground to whose front end a vertical frame of solid timber was rigidly fixed; through the vertical frame ran an axle, which had a single stout spoke. On the extremity of the spoke was a sling used to launch a projectile. Some onagers, as depicted in ancient drawings, used a bowl-shaped bucket instead of a sling to fire the projectile.\nThe onagers of the Roman Empire were mainly used for besieging forts or settlements. They would often be armed with huge stones or rocks that could be covered with a combustible substance and set alight.
tf.scout.history.desc=Speculatores were the scouts and reconnaissance element of the Roman army. In both the legions  and in the praetorian camp, speculatores were initially scouts but became bodyguards, couriers, law-enforcers, and sometimes executioners. Exploratores were tasked to keep watch on enemy movements in the field. Both occupations could require the wearing of 'plain clothes' and may therefore be deemed spies. To a certain extent (but only to an extent) speculatores may be deemed 'internal security' and exploratores 'external security.' However, the Roman Empire lasted a very long time and various espionage units, including the infamous Frumentarii  created by Hadrian to suppress internal dissent came and went throughout its history.
tf.triarii.history.desc=Hastati (singular: Hastatus) were a class of infantry in the armies of the early Roman Republic who originally fought as spearmen, and later as swordsmen. They were originally some of the poorest men in the legion, and could afford only modest equipment—light armour and a large shield, in their service as the lighter infantry of the legion. Later, the hastati contained the younger men rather than just the poorer, though most men of their age were relatively poor. Their usual position was the first battle line. They fought in a quincunx formation, supported by light troops.
tf.urban_cohort.history.desc=Principes (Singular: Princeps) were spearmen, and later swordsmen, in the armies of the early Roman Republic. They were men in the prime of their lives who were fairly wealthy, and could afford decent equipment. They were the heavier infantry of the legion who carried large shields and wore good quality armour. Their usual position was the second battle line. They fought in quincunx  formation, supported by light troops.

tf.trap.history.desc=Traps take up 1 fortification Space, Rockfall 5 Spaces and Barbican 3 Spaces. Traps randomly kill infantry in terms of troop's unit, but Rockfall hits the forefront divisions in terms of damage instead. Traps and Rockfall are one-time use fortifications. Barbican, on the other hand, has HP, and can stand multiple hits. There are certain chances of revival of the fallen fortifications after a battle. The basic revival rate of Rockfall is 6%, Traps 5% and Barbican 3%. Every Reparation upgrade adds additional revival rate to the base rate.
tf.arrowtower.history.desc=Traps take up 1 fortification Space, Rockfall 5 Spaces and Barbican 3 Spaces. Traps randomly kill infantry in terms of troop's unit, but Rockfall hits the forefront divisions in terms of damage instead. Traps and Rockfall are one-time use fortifications. Barbican, on the other hand, has HP, and can stand multiple hits. There are certain chances of revival of the fallen fortifications after a battle. The basic revival rate of Rockfall is 6%, Traps 5% and Barbican 3%. Every Reparation upgrade adds additional revival rate to the base rate.\n\nA barbican (from medieval Latin barbecana, "outer fortification of a city or castle,") is a fortified outpost or gateway, such as an outer defense to a city or castle, or any tower situated over a gate or bridge which was used for defensive purposes. Usually barbicans were situated outside the main line of defences and connected to the city walls with a walled road called the neck. In the 15th century, with the improvement in siege tactics and artillery, barbicans lost their significance. However, several barbicans were built even in the 16th century.

Barbican, on the other hand, has HP, and can stand multiple hits. There are certain chances of revival of the fallen fortifications after a battle. The basic revival rate of Rockfall is 6%, Traps 5% and Barbican 3%. Every Reparation upgrade adds additional revival rate to the base rate.\n\nThe impact of stones should never be underestimated. Prepare fortification with the stones in place ahead of battle. A slight push will roll them down the wall and crush the sieging enemy fighters.

diplomacy.conquest.vassal.desc=<b>Tributary Submission:</b> You may willfully submit tribute to a more powerful city to become its tributary city so that, as sovereign city, it may send sovereign troops to garrison in your city for your own protection. You will send a negligible amount of resources (Crops, Lumber, Stone and Iron) to the sovereign city as a regular token of submission (tribute), which equals 20% of your Base Production. (All production modifiers such as technology, hero boost, and wilderness boost continue to work at 100% of your Base Production.) The sovereign city flag will be placed on top of the tributary city's flag.  \n\n<b>Tributary Acceptation:</b> You may accept tributary submission from other cities and become their sovereign city. It's desirable to acquire as many tributary cities as possible simply because of the resources boost from the tributes.
diplomacy.conquest.leaderCity.desc=<b>Sovereign City:</b> Once the current city becomes a tributary city, you may view the corresponding information of the sovereign city, such as tributary resources amount and sovereign troops garrison information, which may help you estimate the opportune time and the best route to break the sovereignty. Note that the tributary resource amount equals 20% of the Base Production (Crops, Lumber, Stone and Iron). (Your Base Production doesn't decrease!) \n\n<b>Divine Liberty:</b> Apply Divine Liberty to break the sovereignty peacefully without bloodshed. \n\n<b>War of Independence (WoI):</b> Within the first 24 hours of your becoming a tributary city, you may start a WoI by annihilating the sovereign garrison troops from your city by force or by negotiation (sovereign troops move out willfully). WoI, apparently, does not involve Wall and fortifications and it does not generate loot. You lose your right to apply WoI after the first 24 hours even if the sovereign troops move out of your city.\nNote: During the 24-hour period, the garrison troop does not help in defending against the Marauding enemy of the tributary city. \nIf you miss the 24-hour window, you will have to regain independence through applying the Divine Liberty or through successfully Colonizing your sovereign city. (Note that merely by fighting against your sovereign city in Arena, and by participating the last round of battle that your sovereign city is successfully Colonized will enable you to break from the sovereignty.)

military.newArmy.target=Target
military.newArmy.send=Launch
military.newArmy.notice=Notice
military.newArmy.tip.conquest=Colonize: Launch expedition against target city (except the ones owned by league members and by members of the Friendly leagues). Engages battle against its troops (including the fortifications) and reinforcement troops. Every successful Colonization lowers target city Allegiance by 5 and increases Grievance by 5. You may successfully acquire it as Tributary city once its Allegiance drops to 0. Colonization doesn't get you any resource and consumes no Physical of a hero. \nThe Expedition Transit Time (ETT) for the hero who launches Colonization expedition depends on the distance but it will neither be less than 15 minutes nor exceed 4 hours. The ETT for all participating heroes of the Arena equals the hero's who launch it. When the battle is over, the transit time for the heroes who go back to their home cities is calculated based on their respective distance with no minimal required time but will not exceed 4 hours.
military.newArmy.tip.attack=Seize: Launch expedition against target wilderness (except the ones owned by league members and by members of the Friendly leagues). Engages battle against its troops and reinforcement troops (if any). You may successfully acquire the target wilderness as your own once its troops and reinforcement troops (if any) are annihilated. Successful Seize get you one-time resource loot and future production boost. Seize consume a hero's 10 Physical. \nThe Expedition Transit Time (ETT) for the hero who launches the Seize expedition depends on the distance but will not exceed 4 hours. \nThe ETT for all participating heroes of the Arena equals the hero's who launch it. When the battle is over, the transit time for the heroes who go back to their home cities is calculated based on their respective distance but will not exceed 4 hours.
military.newArmy.tip.loot=Maraud: Launch expedition against target wilderness or city (except the ones owned by league members and by members of the Friendly leagues). Engages battle against target wilderness' troop and reinforcement troop (if any); or engages battle against target city's troops (excluding Wall and fortifications) and reinforcement troop. If target city troop chooses not to engage battle, its Allegiance stays the same while you can Maraud one-time resource loot without shedding any blood. Maraud consumes a hero's 10 Physical. \nThe Expedition Transit Time (ETT) for the hero who launches Maraud expedition against wilderness depends on the distance. When it comes to Maraud expedition against a city, the transit time depends on the distance, but it will neither be less than 15 minutes nor exceed 4 hours. \nThe ETT for all participating heroes of the Arena equals the hero's who launch it. When the battle is over, the transit time for the heroes who go back to their home cities is calculated based on their respective distance but will not exceed 4 hours.
military.newArmy.tip.reinforce=Reinforce: Launch expedition against target wilderness or city. If target city is your own, the dispatched hero and troop are to be permanently displaced to the target city. They will draw salary and consume resources from the target city in the future. On the other hand, if the target city is any city but your own, they draw salary and consume resources from the home city (departure city). Both summoning and repatriation can bring them back to the home city. As long as the target city is a Tributary city of one of your cities, your reinforcement troop is seen as sovereign garrison troop which is non-repatriable. On the other hand, reinforcement troop that lands on all other targets is seen as just regular garrison troop. Reinforce doesn't consume a hero's Physical. \nThe ETT for the hero who launches Reinforce expedition depends on the distance.
military.newArmy.tip.scout=Scout: Scout expedition involves Speculatores only. Target location can be any city or wilderness except the cities owned by league members and by Friendly league members. The purpose is to acquire intelligence of the target.\nReconnaissance Lv 1 is the prerequisite for training Speculatores and dispatching Speculatores for Scout expedition. Higher the Reconnaissance level, the more detailed the intelligence reports. It is probable that Scout expedition is done without being detected even if target city has Speculatores. However, if target city Speculatores detect the dispatched Speculatores, Scout Combat occurs. You need at least one of the dispatch Speculatores to survive the Scout Combat to come back to home city to report the intelligence gathered.\nSpeculatore is a special troop's unit which cannot be led by hero (so it doesn't affect any hero's EXP). Scout expedition affects neither Allegiance, Grievance nor Honor. It doesn't award loots. Speculatores that are detected during expedition or defeated in Scout Combat do not drag home city into becoming a Tributary city.

beginnerGuide.desc.1=My noble lord, welcome to the world of Caesary! I'm Hypatia of Ægyptus, head of the Platonist school at Alexandria in 400 AD Roman Egypt. As a philosophy scholar and a teacher of all things, in the next <b>2-3 minutes</b>, I'll walk you through a few basic steps on how to properly build and manage your own city. By following this simple yet powerful tutorial, you get a perfect start! Let the adventure begin!
beginnerGuide.desc.2=The road to power and world domination starts with building up your own cities, study technologies, training and manufacturing troop's units and siege engines, and organize league to battle against enemies. Let's begin by building a <b>Cottage</b>.

beginnerGuide.desc.8=Click the <b>(X)</b> button on the top right corner of Cottage panel to close it.
beginnerGuide.desc.9=My wise lord, so far so good. You have just erected a Cottage. The rest of the Clearings are at your disposal. Now, let's build a <b>Warehouse</b>, where your resources can be stored and <b>protected from</b> other lords who <b>Maraud</b> (raid) your city.
beginnerGuide.desc.10=Click a <b>Clearing</b>. Enter the Erect panel.
beginnerGuide.desc.11=Click the <b>Erect</b> button under Warehouse.

Make it your long term goal to <b>sustain your resource production</b> growth so that you don't have to rush to raise tax in times of need. In the following, I'll guide you to <b>create jobs</b> for the resource fields outside city Wall.

beginnerGuide.desc.51=Click on the <b>Resources</b> tabs on the Shortcut Navigator.
beginnerGuide.desc.52=Behold, my lord of grace! See the <b>negative growth</b> in red on the Shortcut Navigator? We're in deficit due to the Retainer (salary) of the hero paid in Sesterces and the Crops Intake by the troop. Don't worry! You'll shake it off by erecting <b>more Cottages</b> and create <b>more Husbandry Jobs</b>.
beginnerGuide.desc.53=Quest awards contain abundant resources so that you won't see Sesterce or resource shortage any time soon. Besides, you have your own military force now. Go and dispatch them. Launch Maraud expedition against wilderness of level 1-2. The loot will be sufficient to replenish your resource stocks.
beginnerGuide.desc.54=Remember: Neither an <b>Amphitheatre</b> nor a <b>Barracks</b> have been erected. You don't have additional troop to <b>Reinforce</b> your first one. Think twice before launching expedition against wilderness of level 3 or higher.<br>Also, join a league ASAP so you can <b>chat FREE in league channel</b>, where you can get the most help!
beginnerGuide.desc.55=Finally, my lord, ask others on how to <b>Mute</b> profaner or provoker in World chat. Read the <b>mouse-over tips</b> and follow the <b>quests</b>. You can't go wrong! <br><br>Vale!<br><br> Love,<br> Hypatia<br>XOXO
