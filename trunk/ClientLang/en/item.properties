He was born in Miletos and lived during the 5th century BC, on the spring of the Ancient Greece classical epoch.

incHeroPolitics1D.itemDesc=Marcus Tullius Cicero (January 3, 106 BC—December 7, 43 BC) was a Roman  philosopher, statesman, lawyer, political theorist, and Roman constitutionalist. He was member of a wealthy family of the equestrian order, and is widely considered one of Rome's greatest orators and prose stylists.\nCicero is generally perceived to be one of the most versatile minds of ancient Rome. He introduced the Romans to the chief schools of Greek philosophy and created a Latin philosophical vocabulary, distinguishing himself as a linguist, translator, and philosopher. An impressive orator and successful lawyer, Cicero probably thought his political career was his most important achievement. Today, he is appreciated primarily for his humanism and philosophical and political writings. His voluminous correspondence, much of it addressed to his friend Atticus, has been especially influential, introducing the art of refined letter writing to European culture. Cornelius Nepos, the 1st-century BC biographer of Atticus, remarked that Cicero's letters contained such a wealth of detail "concerning the inclinations of leading men, the faults of the generals, and the revolutions in the government" that their reader had little need for a history of the period.

incHeroAttack1D.funcDesc=Buffs Bravery by 25%. Effective for 7 days.

As a military man Dentatus had fought in 120 battles, received 45 honorable wounds and according to Pliny the Elder won the Grass Crown or Blockade Crown (Latin: corona obsidionalis or corona graminea), which was the highest and rarest of all military decorations in the Roman Republic and early Roman empire.
incHeroDefence1D.name=Leonidas Medal
incHeroDefence1D.funcDesc=Leonidas Medal buffs Parry by 25%. Effective for 7 days.
incHeroDefence1D.itemDesc=King Leonidas I of Sparta led the most famous last stands in the Battle of Thermopylae, which was fought between an alliance of Greek city-states, led by Sparta, and the Persian Empire of Xerxes I over the course of three days, during the second Persian invasion of Greece at the pass of Thermopylae ('The Hot Gates'). Xerxes had amassed a huge army and navy, and set out to conquer all of Greece. The Athenian general Themistocles had proposed that the Allied Greeks block the advance of the Persian army at the pass of Thermopylae.\nAn Allied force of approximately 7,000 men thus marched north to block the pass in the summer of 480 BC. The Persian army, alleged by the ancient sources to have numbered in the millions, arrived at the pass in late August or early September. Vastly outnumbered, the Greeks held off the Persians for seven days in total (including three of battle), before the rear-guard was annihilated in one of history's most famous last stands. During two full days of battle, the small force led by King Leonidas I of Sparta blocked the only road by which the massive Persian army could pass.\nBoth ancient and modern writers have used the Battle of Thermopylae as an example of the power of a patriotic army of freemen defending native soil. The performance of the defenders at the battle of Thermopylae is also used as an example of the advantages of training, equipment, and good use of terrain as force multipliers and has become a symbol of courage against overwhelming odds.

incWorkout.itemDesc=Gyms are not too popular in Rome so exercise space is limited. Most heroes idle with nothing to do. Why not get a Gymnasium Pass to get them more exercise access and send more heroes to exercise!\nThe regular training of boys in the Greek gymnastics was foreign to Roman manners, and even held in contempt (Plut. Quaest. Rom. 40). Towards the end of the republic many wealthy Romans, who had acquired a taste for Greek manners, used to attach to their villas small places for bodily exercise, sometimes called gymnasia, sometimes palaestrae, and to adorn them with beautiful works of art (Cic. ad Att. I.4, c. Verr. III.5). The emperor Nero was the first who built a public gymnasium at Rome (Sueton. Ner. 12); another was erected by Commodus (Herod. I.12.4). But although these institutions were intended to introduce Greek gymnastics among the Romans, they never gained any great importance, as the magnificent thermae, amphitheatres, and other colossal buildings had always greater charms for the Romans than the gymnasia.

speedup50pTroop.itemDesc=Commentarii de Bello Gallico (English: Commentaries on the Gallic War) is Julius Caesar's firsthand account of the Gallic Wars, written as a third-person narrative. In it Caesar describes the battles and intrigues that took place in the nine years he spent fighting local armies in Gaul that opposed Roman domination.\nThe "Gaul" that Caesar refers to is sometimes all of Gaul except for the Roman province of Gallia Narbonensis (modern day Provence), encompassing the rest of modern France, Belgium and some of Switzerland. On other occasions, he refers only to that territory inhabited by the Celtic peoples known to the Romans as Gauls, from the English Channel to Lugdunum (Lyon).\nThe account has often been used in teaching Latin. It begins with the common phrase "Gallia est omnis divisa in partes tres" (sometimes quoted as "Omnia Gallia in tres partes divisa est" for "All Gaul is divided into three parts"). The full work is divided into 8 sections, Book 1 to Book 8, each varying in size from approximately 5,000 to 15,000 words. Book 8 was written by Aulus Hirtius after Caesar's death.
incHeroExp1k.name=Greco-Persian Wars
incHeroExp1k.funcDesc=Increases hero's EXP by 8% or 1000 whichever's more.
incHeroExp1k.itemDesc=The Greco-Persian Wars (also often called the Persian Wars) were a series of conflicts between the Achaemenid Empire of Persia and city-states of the Hellenic world that started in 499 BC and lasted until 450 BC. The collision between the fractious political world of the Greeks and the enormous empire of the Persians began when Cyrus the Great conquered Ionia in 547 BC. Struggling to rule the independently-minded cities of Ionia, the Persians appointed tyrants to rule each of them. This would prove the source of much trouble for both Greeks and Persians alike.\nAlmost all the primary sources for the Greco-Persian Wars are Greek; the Persians do not appear to have written anything identifiable as a history of their own. By some distance, the main source for the Greco-Persian Wars is the Greek historian Herodotus. Herodotus, who has been called the "Father of History", was born in 484 BC in Halicarnassus, Asia Minor (then under Persian overlordship). He wrote his 'Enquiries' (Greek—Historia; English—(The) Histories) around 440—430 BC, trying to trace the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars, which would still have been relatively recent history. Herodotus's approach was entirely novel, and at least in Western society, he does seem to have invented 'history' as a discipline. As Holland has it: "For the first time, a chronicler set himself to trace the origins of a conflict not to a past so remote as to be utterly fabulous, nor to the whims and wishes of some god, nor to a people's claim to manifest destiny, but rather explanations he could verify personally."
incHeroExp10k.name=Peloponnesian War
incHeroExp10k.funcDesc=Increases hero's EXP by 10000 or by 30% whichever's more.
incHeroExp10k.itemDesc=The Peloponnesian War, 431 to 404 B.C., was an ancient Greek war, fought by Athens and its empire against the Peloponnesian League, led by Sparta. Historians have traditionally divided the war into three phases. In the first phase, the Archidamian War, Sparta launched repeated invasions of Attica, while Athens took advantage of its naval supremacy to raid the coast of the Peloponnese attempting to suppress signs of unrest in its empire. This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC, with the signing of the Peace of Nicias. That treaty, however, was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese. In 415 BC, Athens dispatched a massive expeditionary force to attack Syracuse in Sicily; the attack failed disastrously, with the destruction of the entire force, in 413 BC. This ushered in the final phase of the war, generally referred to either as the Decelean War, or the Ionian War. In this phase, Sparta, now receiving support from Persia, supported rebellions in Athens' subject states in the Aegean Sea and Ionia, undermining Athens' empire, and eventually depriving the city of naval supremacy. The destruction of Athens' fleet at Aegospotami effectively ended the war, and Athens surrendered in the following year.\nThe Peloponnesian War reshaped the Ancient Greek world. On the level of international relations, Athens, the strongest city-state in Greece prior to the war's beginning, was reduced to a state of near-complete subjection, while Sparta became established as the leading power of Greece. The economic costs of the war were felt all across Greece; poverty became widespread in the Peloponnese, while Athens found itself completely devastated, and never regained its pre-war prosperity. The war also wrought subtler changes to Greek society; the conflict between democratic Athens and oligarchic Sparta, each of which supported friendly political factions within other states, made civil war a common occurrence in the Greek world. \nGreek warfare, meanwhile, originally a limited and formalized form of conflict, was transformed into an all-out struggle between city-states, complete with atrocities on a large scale. Shattering religious and cultural taboos, devastating vast swathes of countryside, and destroying whole cities, the Peloponnesian War marked the dramatic end to the fifth-century-B.C. golden age of Greece.
incHeroExp100k.name=Anabasis Alexandri
incHeroExp100k.funcDesc=Increases hero's EXP by 100000 or by 100% whichever's more.
incHeroExp100k.itemDesc=Anabasis Alexandri, the Campaigns of Alexander by Arrian is the most important source on Alexander the Great.\nThe Greek term anabasis referred to an expedition from a coastline into the interior of a country. The term katabasis referred to a trip from the interior to the coast. So a more literal translation would be The Expedition of Alexander.\nThis work on Alexander is the one of the few surviving complete accounts of the Macedonian conqueror's expedition. Arrian was able to use sources which are now lost, such as the contemporary works by Callisthenes (the nephew of Alexander's tutor Aristotle), Onesicritus, Nearchus, and Aristobulus, and the slightly later work of Cleitarchus. Most important of all, Arrian had the biography of Alexander by Ptolemy, one of Alexander's leading generals and possibly his half-brother.\nIt is primarily a military history, it has little to say about Alexander's personal life, his role in Greek politics or the reasons why the campaign against Persia was launched in the first place.
speedupFort.name=Pulley Crane
speedupFort.funcDesc=Shortens the remaining time of all fortification planting in a city by 50%. Further shortening by reapplication is not allowed. There's a certain possibility that all planting is finished instantly upon application!
speedupFort.itemDesc=Lengthy accounts by the engineers Vitruvius (De Architectura 10.2, 1-10) and Heron of Alexandria (Mechanica 3.2-5).\nFive pulley cranes (Pentaspastos) or, in case of the largest one, a set of three by five pulleys (Polyspastos) and came with two, three or four masts, depending on the maximum load. The Polyspastos, when worked by four men at both sides of the winch, could already lift 3000 kg (3 ropes x 5 pulleys x 4 men x 50 kg = 3000 kg). In case the winch was replaced by a treadwheel, the maximum load even doubled to 6000 kg at only half the crew, since the treadwheel possesses a much bigger mechanical advantage due to its larger diameter. This meant that, in comparison to the construction of the Egyptian Pyramids, where about 50 men were needed to move a 2.5 ton stone block up the ramp (50 kg per person), the lifting capability of the Roman Polyspastos proved to be 60 times higher (3000 kg per person).

hero.loyalty.1.funcDesc=A luxury item that's necessary to promote certain level of noble rank and to recruit some of the high heroes (heroes with POT). When used to reward a hero, one's Loyalty increases by 5.
hero.loyalty.1.itemDesc=Romans grasped the techniques of dyeing by 715 BC. Dye was widely used and also served as a decent gift among friends. Women dyed their hair with goat fat and beech wood ashes. Red and blond were the most popular colors.\nHaustellum brandaris, was used as a red dye, due to its purple-red color (6,6'-dibromoindigotin); the color of the emperor. A more widely used tint was indigo, allowing blue or yellow shades, while madder, a dicotyledon angiosperm, produced a shade of red and was one of the cheapest dyes available. According to Pliny the Elder, a blackish color was preferred to red. Yellow, obtained from saffron, was expensive and reserved for the clothing of married women or the Vestal Virgins. There were far fewer colours than we have today.
hero.loyalty.2.name=Spices
hero.loyalty.2.funcDesc=A luxury item that's necessary to promote certain level of noble rank and to recruit some of the high heroes (heroes with POT). When used to reward a hero, one's Loyalty increases by 10.
hero.loyalty.2.itemDesc=Highly sought after in Rome. Soldiers would be cheered if they brought back some of the more exotic ones from abroad.\nThe earliest evidence of the use of spice by humans was around 50,000 B.C. The spice trade developed throughout the Middle East in around 2000 BC with cinnamon and pepper. The Egyptians used herbs for embalming and their need for exotic herbs helped stimulate world trade. In fact, the word spice comes from the same root as species, meaning kinds of goods. By 1000 BC China and India had a medical system based upon herbs. Early uses were connected with magic, medicine, religion, tradition, and preservation.\nThe ancient Indian epic of Ramayana mentions cloves. In any case, it is known that the Romans had cloves in the 1st century AD because Pliny the Elder spoke of them in his writings.
hero.loyalty.3.name=Wine
hero.loyalty.3.funcDesc=A luxury item that's necessary to promote certain level of noble rank and to recruit some of the high heroes (heroes with POT). When used to reward a hero, one's Loyalty increases by 15.
hero.loyalty.3.itemDesc=In Rome, people drank wine at every meal, making one to wonder if a modern day Roman would pour Chardonnay into his Cocoa Puffs. Even slaves, slaves who were thought to exist on the same spectrum as mongrel dogs, were allowed to drink wine. A life of servitude, to the Romans, seemed reasonable, but a life without wine was out of the question; it was simply preposterous.\nPossessing an affinity for wines that could grow old, the Romans often sipped the spirits of wine aged ten or twenty years. Their wines were also, in keeping with the reputation of the excess known to mark their culture, high in alcohol content.\nThe Romans were well educated in the different grape varieties and the different regions from which they came. They were also very inventive with their wine, often adding ingredients to alter the taste. Among the ingredients they experimented with were saltwater, honey, herbs and chalk.
hero.loyalty.4.name=Wool
hero.loyalty.4.funcDesc=A luxury item that's necessary to promote certain level of noble rank and to recruit some of the high heroes (heroes with POT). When used to reward a hero, one's Loyalty increases by 20.
hero.loyalty.4.itemDesc=As the raw material has been readily available since the widespread domestication of sheep - and of goats, another major provider of wool - the use of felted or woven wool for clothing and other fabrics characterizes some of the earliest civilizations. Prior to invention of shears - probably in the Iron Age - the wool was plucked out by hand or by bronze combs. The oldest known European wool textile, ca. 1500 BCE, was preserved in a Danish bog. Wool fibers from wild goats found in a prehistoric cave in the Republic of Georgia as far back 34,000 BCE suggest that wool fabrics were made even earlier than this.\nIn Roman times, wool, linen, and leather clothed the European population; the cotton of India was a curiosity that only naturalists had heard of; and silk, imported along the Silk Road from China, was an extravagant luxury. Pliny the Elder records in his Natural History that the reputation for producing the finest wool was enjoyed by Tarentum, where selective breeding had produced sheep with a superior fleece, but which required special care.
hero.loyalty.5.name=Silk
hero.loyalty.5.funcDesc=A luxury item that's necessary to promote certain level of noble rank and to recruit some of the high heroes (heroes with POT). When used to reward a hero, one's Loyalty increases by 25.
hero.loyalty.5.itemDesc=Silk can be woven into heavy brocade or light, gauzy fabric. Its versatility and beauty make it perennially popular. The Romans traded for it, using the Parthians as intermediaries for centuries, but under Emperor Justinian they found the way to produce it for themselves.\nThe Byzantine historian Procopius tells the story of how the Roman Empire acquired its own source of silk in book 8.17.1-8 of Procopius' History of the Wars. Although Justinian may have wanted to save the cost of importing, the passage from Procopius first mentions the desire not to trade with the enemy -- the Persians.\nThe story Procopius tells is that some (Nestorian) monks from Sogdiana who knew Justinian didn't want to buy silk from the Persians, told him that they could arrange it so that he would no longer have to buy from any other nation. They told him that it was impossible to bring the silkworms themselves from "Serinda" (an area north of India, i.e., China), but it was possible to take their offspring, cocoons, buried in dung. After Justinian promised to reward the monks well, they did as they had described, and brought the Chinese silkworms to the Roman Empire where the newly-hatched worms fed on mulberry leaves.
hero.loyalty.6.name=Furs
hero.loyalty.6.funcDesc=A luxury item that's necessary to promote certain level of noble rank and to recruit some of the high heroes (heroes with POT). When used to reward a hero, one's Loyalty increases by 30.
hero.loyalty.6.itemDesc=The use of the hair from animal pelts to make felt was probably started by wandering peoples in Central Asia. They used the hair of goats, sheep, camels and other animals to make their tents. They found that felt lasted a long time and was easily made. One of the best furs for making felt was beaver. It became very valuable.\nLater, many peoples such as the Chinese, the Greeks and the Romans used it as padding under heavy armour, or to stop arrows. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the art of making felt was lost in Western Europe for a very long time.
hero.loyalty.7.name=Incense
hero.loyalty.7.funcDesc=A luxury item that's necessary to promote certain level of noble rank and to recruit some of the high heroes (heroes with POT). When used to reward a hero, one's Loyalty increases by 40.
hero.loyalty.7.itemDesc=Religious use of incense has its origins in antiquity. The burned incense may be intended as a sacrificial offering to various deities or to serve as an aid in prayer.\nIncense (Latin: incendere, "to burn") is composed of aromatic biotic materials, which release fragrant smoke when burned. The term incense refers to the substance itself, rather than to the odor that it produces.\nMany religious ceremonies and spiritual purificatory rites employ incense, a practice that persists to this day. Incense is also used in medicine and for its aesthetic value. The forms taken by incense have changed with advances in technology, differences in the underlying culture, and diversity in the reasons for burning it.\nIt was used in Egypt, where the gums and resins of aromatic trees were imported from the Arabian and Somali coasts to be used in religious ceremonies. It was also used by the Pharaohs, not only to counteract unpleasant odors, but also to drive away demons and gratify the presence of the gods, as they believed.
hero.loyalty.8.name=Ivory
hero.loyalty.8.funcDesc=A luxury item that's necessary to promote certain level of noble rank and to recruit some of the high heroes (heroes with POT). When used to reward a hero, one's Loyalty increases by 50.
hero.loyalty.8.itemDesc=Ivory is formed from dentine and constitutes the bulk of the teeth and tusks of animals such as the elephant, hippopotamus, walrus, mammoth and narwhal.\nThe word "ivory" was traditionally applied to the tusks of elephants; the word is ultimately from Ancient Egyptian âb, âbu "elephant", through the Latin ebor- or ebur.\nIvory has availed itself to many ornamental and practical uses.
hero.loyalty.9.name=Diamond
hero.loyalty.9.funcDesc=A luxury item that's necessary to promote certain level of noble rank and to recruit some of the high heroes (heroes with POT). When used to reward a hero, one's Loyalty increases by 60.
hero.loyalty.9.itemDesc=Diamonds have been treasured as gemstones since their use as religious icons in ancient India. Their usage in engraving tools also dates to early human history.\nThe name diamond is derived from the ancient Greek ἀδάμας (adámas), "proper", "unalterable", "unbreakable, untamed", from ἀ- (a-), "un-" + δαμάω (damáō), "I overpower, I tame". Diamonds are thought to have been first recognized and mined in India, where significant alluvial deposits of the stone could be found many centuries ago along the rivers Penner, Krishna and Godavari. Diamonds have been known in India for at least 3,000 years but most likely 6,000 years.
